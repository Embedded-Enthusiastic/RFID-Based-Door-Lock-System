# RFID-Based-Door-Lock-System
üìñ Overview
This project implements an RFID-based Door Lock System using an Arduino microcontroller. The system allows only authorized RFID tags to unlock a door, enhancing security for homes, offices, or other restricted areas. It is an excellent introduction to embedded systems, RFID technology, and automation.

üõ†Ô∏è Features
RFID Authentication: Secure access using unique RFID tags.
Visual Indicators: LED feedback for access status (green for granted, red for denied).
Door Mechanism Control: A servo motor locks and unlocks the door.
Customizable Access: Easily add or remove authorized tags.
Optional Alerts: Buzzer for denied access or other alerts.
üîß Hardware Requirements
Arduino Board (e.g., Uno, Nano)
RFID Reader Module (e.g., MFRC522)
RFID Tags (Key fobs or cards)
Servo Motor
LEDs (Green and Red)
Buzzer (optional)
Resistors (220Œ©)
Breadboard and Jumper Wires
üñ•Ô∏è Software Requirements
Arduino IDE (Download: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
MFRC522 Library: For RFID module support (Install Guide).
Servo Library: Built-in with the Arduino IDE.
